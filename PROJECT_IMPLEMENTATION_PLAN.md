## Quality Gates & Validation Requirements

### Mandatory Validation Process
1. **Task Completion Criteria**: Each task must meet 100% of defined acceptance criteria
2. **Testing Requirements**: All functionality must be tested and validated before marking complete
3. **Documentation**: All changes must be documented with rationale
4. **No Progression Rule**: Cannot advance to next task until current task passes all quality gates
5. **Change Tracking**: All modifications, demotions, cancellations must include detailed notes

### Quality Gate Checklist Template
- [ ] Acceptance criteria 100% met
- [ ] Functionality tested and working
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code committed to GitHub
- [ ] No regressions in existing functionality
- [ ] Task marked as COMPLETED with validation notes

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Frontend Restructuring**: Risk of breaking existing functionality
2. **Database Migration**: Potential data loss during MariaDB cleanup
3. **API Integration**: Complex multi-service coordination
4. **Performance**: Real-time analysis may impact responsiveness

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Incremental Changes**: Small, testable changes with immediate validation
2. **Backup Strategy**: Full backup before any major changes
3. **Rollback Plan**: Ability to revert any change within 5 minutes
4. **Testing Protocol**: Comprehensive testing at each step

---

## Daily Execution Protocol

### Daily Startup Process
1. Load PROJECT_STATUS.md to understand current state
2. Review TASK_TRACKER.json for active task details
3. Execute standardized resumption prompt
4. Validate current task status
5. Proceed with work or handle blockers

### Daily Completion Process
1. Update task progress in TASK_TRACKER.json
2. Document work completed and any issues
3. Update PROJECT_STATUS.md with current state
4. Commit changes to GitHub if applicable
5. Prepare next day's starting point

## Success Metrics

### Phase-Level Metrics
- **Phase 0**: Clean repository, accurate documentation, working database config
- **Phase 1**: Modular frontend (<200 lines per file), modern UI, preserved functionality  
- **Phase 2**: Content processing pipeline working, real-time feedback operational
- **Phase 3**: Learning systems functional, progress tracking active
- **Phase 4**: Production-ready platform exceeding reference applications

### Project-Level Metrics
- **Functionality**: All reference app features implemented and working
- **Performance**: Content processing <2 minutes, real-time feedback <500ms
- **Usability**: Family members can use independently
- **Maintainability**: Modular, documented, configurable codebase
- **Cost**: Operational costs remain under $30/month

## Change Management Process

### Task Status Definitions
- **PENDING**: Not yet started, all prerequisites met
- **IN_PROGRESS**: Currently being worked on
- **BLOCKED**: Cannot proceed due to dependency or issue
- **TESTING**: Implementation complete, undergoing validation
- **COMPLETED**: All acceptance criteria met and validated
- **DEMOTED**: Moved to lower priority due to changed requirements
- **CANCELLED**: No longer needed or feasible
- **SKIPPED**: Temporarily bypassed with documented rationale

### Required Documentation for Status Changes
- **Completion**: Validation results, testing evidence, commit references
- **Demotion**: Reason for priority change, new timeline, impact analysis
- **Cancellation**: Justification, alternative approach, resource reallocation
- **Skip**: Temporary reason, planned return conditions, risk assessment

## Architectural Principles

### Core Design Principles
1. **Modularity**: Each component should be independently testable and replaceable
2. **Configurability**: All behavior should be configurable without code changes
3. **Adaptability**: System should adapt to user learning patterns and preferences
4. **Privacy**: Family data remains local and secure
5. **Cost-Awareness**: All operations consider budget impact
6. **Voice-First**: Audio interaction should be primary, with visual as enhancement
7. **Multi-Generational**: Suitable for children and adults in same family

### Technical Constraints
- **Budget**: $30/month maximum operational cost
- **Performance**: Real-time response requirements for speech interaction
- **Privacy**: No data sharing with external services beyond necessary API calls
- **Scalability**: Support for family of 4-6 users
- **Reliability**: 99%+ uptime for family learning sessions

## Integration Requirements

### Reference Application Feature Mapping
- **YouLearn AI**: Content processing, quiz generation, learning material creation
- **Pingo AI**: Conversation scenarios, pronunciation feedback, speaking practice
- **Fluently AI**: Real-time analysis, live feedback, professional communication
- **Airlearn**: Structured learning, spaced repetition, progress tracking

### Unique Differentiators
- **Multi-LLM Intelligence**: Language-specific AI models for optimal learning
- **Family Dashboard**: Parent oversight and progress monitoring
- **Cost Management**: Automatic budget tracking and local fallbacks
- **Voice Integration**: Speech-first learning experience
- **Cultural Context**: Deep language and cultural integration

## Project Governance

### Decision Making Process
1. **Technical Decisions**: Based on architectural principles and performance requirements
2. **Feature Prioritization**: User learning effectiveness takes precedence
3. **Resource Allocation**: Critical functionality before nice-to-have features
4. **Quality Standards**: No compromise on stability and data safety

### Review and Approval Gates
- **Phase Completion**: All tasks validated and tested
- **Architecture Changes**: Impact analysis and rollback plan required
- **External Dependencies**: Cost and privacy impact assessment
- **Production Deployment**: Full system validation and backup completion
