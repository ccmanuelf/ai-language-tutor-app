## **1. Design Philosophy**

### **1.1 Core Principles**
The design of the AI Language Tutor App is rooted in principles that prioritize natural interaction, contextual learning, and user autonomy, all within a high-performance environment.

* **Conversation-First**: The interface should feel like a natural dialogue, not a rigid application, encouraging fluid communication.
* **Context-Aware**: Visual cues and interactive elements should seamlessly connect uploaded content or selected scenarios to ongoing conversations.
* **Performance-Focused**: Interactions must be fast and responsive, especially for real-time speech processing and AI feedback, to ensure an uninterrupted learning flow.
* **Progressive Disclosure**: Complexity is revealed gradually, ensuring users are not overwhelmed and can advance at their own pace.
* **Intuitive & Accessible for All Users**: The design ensures ease of use for all family members, regardless of age, with no built-in restrictions or parental controls, aligning with the principle of full user autonomy.

### **1.2 Design Inspiration Integration**
The design draws inspiration from leading applications, adapting their best practices to our unique context:
* **YouLearn.ai**: Influences the clean content processing and chat interface.
* **LanguaTalk**: Inspires structured topic selection and conversation modes.
* **Aqua Voice**: Contributes to context awareness and smart customization features.

## **2. User Experience Strategy**

### **2.1 User Journey Mapping**
The user journey is streamlined to facilitate quick access to personalized learning experiences, with all family members (Father, Daughter, Son) following the same autonomous flow.

**Standard User Flow (All Family Members)**:
```
Login → Profile Selection (to switch between users) → 
Content Upload/Scenario Selection → Document Preview (if content uploaded) → 
Conversation Setup → Active Chat → Progress Review → Session End
```

### **2.2 Interaction Patterns**

* **Dual-Path Content Strategy**:
    1.  **Upload Path**: User uploads Document/Image/Link → AI Processes Content → Contextual Conversation Initiated.
    2.  **Scenario Path**: User Selects Context/Scenario → AI Generates Initial Prompt → Conversation Initiated.
* **Speech Interaction Patterns**:
    * **Push-to-Talk (PTT)**: A prominent microphone button for voice input.
    * **Real-time Feedback**: Visual and auditory cues for pronunciation and grammar corrections during or immediately after speech.
    * **Text Input**: Option for typing responses when speech is not preferred.

### **2.3 Emotional Design**

* **Positive Reinforcement**: Subtle animations and encouraging messages for progress and correct responses.
* **Clear Error Handling**: Friendly, actionable messages for system errors or misunderstandings.
* **Visual Consistency**: A unified aesthetic across all screens to build trust and familiarity.

### **2.4 User Feedback Mechanisms**

* **Pronunciation Feedback**: Visual waveform analysis or highlighted text indicating areas for improvement (tone, timing, accent).
* **Grammar Correction**: In-line suggestions or corrected text displayed alongside the original input.
* **Progress Visualization**: Graphical representation of learning streaks and topic mastery.

## **3. Interface Design Elements**

### **3.1 Layout and Structure**
The application employs a responsive, adaptive layout suitable for various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
* **Top Navigation Bar**: Consistent across all pages, housing essential controls.
* **Main Content Area**: Dominated by the conversation panel. When content is uploaded, this area dynamically splits into a **Content Preview section** (left/top) and a **Conversation/Feedback section** (right/bottom).
* **Side Panel (Optional/Collapsed)**: For historical conversations (session notes, not full logs) and learning progress.

### **3.2 Color Palette and Typography**
* **Primary Color**: Professional blue (#3498db) for main actions and branding.
* **Accent Colors**: Green for positive feedback (#2ecc71), red for errors/corrections (#e74c3c), yellow for warnings/hints (#f1c40f).
* **Typography**: Clean, readable sans-serif fonts (e.g., Inter, Roboto) for all text elements.

### **3.3 Iconography**
Utilize a consistent icon set (e.g., Font Awesome, Material Icons) for intuitive navigation and actions (e.g., microphone, upload, settings, logout).

### **3.4 Imagery and Media**
Minimize decorative imagery to maintain focus on content. Utilize dynamic elements for feedback visualization (e.g., speech waveforms, highlighted text).

## **4. Core UI Screens/Components**

### **4.1 Login & Profile Selection**
* **Login Screen**: Simple, uncluttered interface with fields for email, password, "Remember Me," "Forgot Password," and "Sign Up."
* **Profile Selection Screen**: A clear display of available family user profiles. Users select their profile to access their learning journey. This allows seamless switching between autonomous user accounts without any administrative approval or restrictions.

### **4.2 Main Conversation Interface**
* **Top Navigation Bar**:
    * **Language Selector**: Dropdown menu for dynamically changing the target language.
    * **Mode Switch**: Toggle for online/offline operation with clear visual indicator ("powered by Ollama • offline" banner when local LLM is active).
    * **Logout Button**: Securely ends the user session.
* **Chat Panel**:
    * **Message Bubbles**: Clearly differentiate AI responses from user inputs.
    * **Input Field**: Text area for typing messages.
    * **Microphone Button**: Prominent button to activate speech input (Push-to-Talk).
    * **Send Button**: To submit text input.
* **Content Preview Area (Dynamic Split-Screen)**:
    * Activated upon content upload (document, image, link).
    * Displays the content (e.g., PDF preview, image viewer, linked webpage snippet).
    * Scrollable and interactive for context.
    * A clear reminder that **uploaded content is not saved persistently after logout**.
* **Feedback Display**:
    * **Pronunciation**: Visual overlay or colored text on user's spoken words, indicating accuracy and areas for improvement.
    * **Grammar**: Subtle highlights or annotations on text input, offering corrections or alternative phrasing.

### **4.3 Modals**

* **Content Upload Modal**: Intuitive drag-and-drop or browse functionality for file uploads, and a text field for links. Includes accepted file types and size limits.
* **Scenario Selection Modal**: Presents a categorized list of predefined conversation scenarios.

### **4.4 Progress Tracking Dashboard**

* **Streak Counter**: Visually prominent display of the current "Don't break the chain" streak.
* **Learning Overview**: Graphical representation of topics engaged, languages practiced, and high-level progress feedback, **without displaying full conversation histories**.

## **5. Style Guide & Component Library**

The UI will be built using **FastHTML and MonsterUI**, ensuring a lightweight, Python-first, and highly performant frontend.

### **5.1 HTML Structure & Attributes**
* Semantic HTML5 tags for structure.
* `data-` attributes for dynamic content and Alpine.js (if used within MonsterUI components).

### **5.2 CSS Naming Conventions (Conceptual, aligned with MonsterUI/Tailwind principles)**
```css
/* Layout classes */
.container { /* Max width, centered */ }
.flex-column { /* flex-direction: column */ }

/* Component classes */
.btn-primary { @apply bg-blue-600 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded; }
.chat-bubble { @apply p-3 rounded-lg max-w-lg; }
.chat-bubble--user { @apply bg-blue-500 text-white ml-auto; }
.chat-bubble--ai { @apply bg-gray-50 mr-auto; }

/* State classes */
.speech-active { @apply ring-2 ring-red-500 ring-opacity-50; }
.pronunciation-correct { @apply bg-green-50 border-green-200; }
