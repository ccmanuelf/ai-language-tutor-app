# Test Plans & Quality Assurance Strategy
## AI Language Tutor App - Document #9: Comprehensive Testing Framework

### **Document Overview**

This document establishes comprehensive testing strategies and quality assurance procedures for the AI Language Tutor App. Based on validation from Qwen Max, this strategy addresses critical testing aspects for AI-powered language learning, API cost optimization, and security compliance while maintaining our $30/month budget constraint.

### **Executive Summary**

Our testing approach prioritizes **security and compliance** (especially for data privacy), **core functionality** (pronunciation feedback and conversations), and **performance optimization** (API cost management). This document provides actionable testing frameworks, automated procedures, and budget-conscious strategies to ensure robust quality assurance throughout development and deployment phases.

        4. Unit Tests →
        5. Integration Tests →
        6. E2E Tests (on staging) →
        7. Deployment (if all checks pass).
