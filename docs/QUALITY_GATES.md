# Quality Gates & Validation Framework

## Overview

This document defines the mandatory quality gates, validation requirements, and testing protocols that every task must pass before being marked as COMPLETED. The quality gate system ensures systematic progress while maintaining code integrity and project stability.

---

## Core Quality Principles

### 1. No Advancement Without Validation
- **Rule**: Cannot proceed to next task until current task passes ALL quality gates
- **Enforcement**: Automated checking via task tracker status
- **Exception Process**: Only project lead can override with documented justification

### 2. 100% Acceptance Criteria Compliance
- **Requirement**: Every acceptance criterion must be fully met
- **Verification**: Each criterion requires specific validation evidence
- **Documentation**: Results must be documented in task tracker

### 3. Comprehensive Testing Protocol
- **Scope**: All functionality must be tested before completion
- **Evidence**: Testing results must be documented and verifiable
- **Regression**: Must verify no existing functionality is broken

### 4. Change Documentation Standard
- **Requirement**: All changes must include rationale and impact analysis
- **Tracking**: Modifications, demotions, cancellations require detailed notes
- **History**: Complete audit trail maintained in task tracker

## Validation Procedures

### Task Completion Validation Process

#### Step 1: Self-Assessment
```
1. Review all acceptance criteria
2. Test all functionality thoroughly
3. Verify no regressions exist
4. Document testing evidence
5. Confirm all quality gates passed
```

#### Step 2: Documentation Update
```
1. Update task tracker with results
2. Document any issues encountered
3. Record validation evidence
4. Note any deviations or exceptions
5. Prepare summary for review
```

#### Step 3: Final Verification
```
1. Independent verification of claims
2. Spot-check testing of critical functionality
3. Review documentation completeness
4. Confirm repository synchronization
5. Authorize task completion
```

### Testing Requirements by Task Type

#### Documentation Tasks
```
□ Content accuracy verified
□ Links and references functional
□ File organization logical and navigable
□ Search and discovery working
□ Information completeness confirmed
```

#### Code Development Tasks
```
□ Unit tests pass (where applicable)
□ Integration tests successful
□ Performance benchmarks met
□ Error handling validated
□ Code review completed
```

#### UI/UX Tasks
```
□ Visual design meets specifications
□ Interaction flows work correctly
□ Responsive behavior confirmed
□ Accessibility requirements met
□ User experience testing completed
```

#### Integration Tasks
```
□ Component integration verified
□ Data flow working correctly
□ API integration functional

## Exception Handling

### Quality Gate Override Process

#### When Overrides May Be Considered
- Critical blocker preventing project progress
- External dependency failure beyond project control
- Scope change requiring modified acceptance criteria
- Technical limitation discovered requiring alternative approach

#### Override Requirements
```
□ Detailed justification documented
□ Risk assessment completed
□ Mitigation strategy defined
□ Timeline impact analyzed
□ Alternative validation approach established
```

#### Override Authorization
- Only project lead can authorize overrides
- All overrides require documented approval
- Override reasons tracked in task tracker
- Regular review of override patterns

### Failure Recovery Process

#### When Tasks Fail Quality Gates
```
1. Identify specific failed criteria
2. Assess scope of additional work required
3. Update task status to IN_PROGRESS
4. Document failure reasons and remediation plan
5. Revise timeline and dependencies if needed
```

#### Remediation Strategy
```
1. Address failed criteria systematically
2. Re-test all affected functionality
3. Update documentation to reflect changes
4. Re-attempt quality gate validation
5. Document lessons learned
```

## Emergency Procedures

### Project Recovery Protocol

#### When Quality System Fails
```
1. Immediately halt all task progression
2. Assess scope of quality system failure
3. Identify last known good state
4. Implement recovery procedures
5. Re-establish quality controls before proceeding
```

#### Data Loss Recovery
```
1. Identify extent of data loss
2. Restore from most recent backup
3. Reconstruct lost work if possible
4. Document recovery process
5. Implement additional safeguards
```

### Escalation Procedures
- Project lead notification for quality failures
- Stakeholder communication for significant delays
- External resource engagement if needed
- Project timeline adjustment protocols
