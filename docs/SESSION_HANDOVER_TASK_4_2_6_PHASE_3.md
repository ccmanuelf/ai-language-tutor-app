## 🎯 Phase 3 Objectives - Dependency Audit

### **Status**: READY TO START

### **Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

### **Objectives**:
1. ✅ **Outdated Packages**: Identify packages needing updates
2. ✅ **Deprecation Warnings**: Audit external libraries for deprecations
3. ✅ **Security Vulnerabilities**: Check for security issues
4. ✅ **Transitive Dependencies**: Validate indirect dependencies
5. ✅ **Compatibility**: Ensure Python 3.12/3.13/3.14 compatibility

### **Tools to Use**:
- **pip list --outdated** - Find outdated packages
- **pip-audit** - Security vulnerability scanner (install if needed)
- **pip check** - Dependency conflict detection
- **requirements.txt analysis** - Manual review

### **Scope**:
- All packages in `requirements.txt` (current: 100+ dependencies)
- Transitive dependencies (indirect)
- Security vulnerabilities (CVEs)
- Compatibility with Python 3.12+

### **Success Criteria**:
- Zero outdated critical packages (or documented upgrade plan)
- Zero security vulnerabilities (or documented mitigation)
- Zero dependency conflicts
- All packages compatible with Python 3.12/3.13/3.14
- Documentation of any accepted technical debt

---

## 📋 Phase 3 Execution Plan

### Step 1: Check for Outdated Packages
```bash
pip list --outdated
```
**Expected Output**: List of packages with newer versions available

### Step 2: Install pip-audit (if needed)
```bash
pip install pip-audit
```

### Step 3: Run Security Audit
```bash
pip-audit
```
**Expected Output**: Security vulnerabilities (CVEs) if any

### Step 4: Check Dependency Conflicts
```bash
pip check
```
**Expected Output**: Should be "No broken requirements found"

### Step 5: Analyze requirements.txt
- Review all packages for deprecation notices
- Check official documentation for breaking changes
- Identify packages that should be upgraded vs pinned

### Step 6: Categorize Findings
- **Critical**: Security vulnerabilities, broken dependencies
- **High**: Outdated packages with breaking changes
- **Medium**: Outdated packages with new features
- **Low**: Minor version updates

### Step 7: Fix Critical Issues
- Upgrade packages with security vulnerabilities
- Resolve dependency conflicts
- Test after each upgrade

### Step 8: Document Decisions
- Why packages were upgraded or kept
- Any known issues with current versions
- Future upgrade recommendations

### Step 9: Validation
```bash
# Re-run environment validation
python scripts/validate_environment.py

# Re-run static analysis
python scripts/static_analysis_audit.py

# Re-run integration tests
pytest test_phase4_integration.py -v
```

### Step 10: Update requirements.txt
- Commit updated requirements.txt
- Document all changes in PHASE_3_COMPLETION_REPORT.md
