### **2. Foundational Principles for Project Management**

#### **2.1 Agile-Inspired Approach**

- **Iterative Development**: Small, manageable iterations for feature delivery.
- **Continuous Feedback**: Regular validation points with the "family users" (developer and children) to ensure relevance and usability.
- **Adaptability**: Flexibility to adjust plans based on new insights or AI model updates.
- **Transparency**: Clear visibility into project progress and roadblocks.

#### **2.2 Solo Developer Optimization**

- **Minimal Overhead**: Focus on tools and processes that add value without excessive administrative burden.
- **Automation First**: Automate repetitive tasks (testing, deployment) to free up development time.
- **Self-Documentation**: Prioritize self-documenting code and clear architectural decisions.
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Leverage GitHub features for tracking, rather than synchronous meetings.

### **3. Project Management Tools & Systems**

#### **3.1 GitHub as the Primary Hub**

- **Repositories**: Separate repositories for frontend, backend, and documentation (or monorepo if preferred for simplicity).
- **Issues**: Use GitHub Issues for bug tracking, feature requests, and task management.
    - **Labels**: `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, `high-priority`, `backend`, `frontend`, `AI`, `DB`.
    - **Milestones**: Link issues to specific documentation or development phases.
- **Projects (Kanban Board)**: Utilize GitHub Projects for visual task tracking (To Do, In Progress, Done).
- **Pull Requests**: For code reviews and merging changes.

#### **3.2 Documentation Management**

- **Markdown (.md) Files**: All project documentation stored as Markdown files within the repository.
- **Version Control**: Git for tracking changes to documents.
- **Local Editors**: Any preferred Markdown editor (e.g., VS Code).

### **5. Estimation & Prioritization**

#### **5.1 Effort Estimation (T-Shirt Sizing)**

- **S (Small)**: Days (e.g., bug fixes, minor UI tweaks)
- **M (Medium)**: 1-2 Weeks (e.g., new API endpoint, simple feature)
- **L (Large)**: 2-4 Weeks (e.g., major feature, complex integration)
- **XL (Extra Large)**: Months (e.g., core architectural component, large system overhaul)

#### **5.2 Prioritization Matrix**

- **P1 (Critical)**: Must have for MVP, blocking development.
- **P2 (High)**: Important for core functionality, next priority after P1.
- **P3 (Medium)**: Nice to have, can be deferred to later phases.
- **P4 (Low)**: Future consideration, non-essential.

### **6. Risk Management**

#### **6.1 Identified Risks**

- **API Cost Overruns**: Exceeding the $30/month budget.
- **Technical Complexity**: Specific integrations (e.g., speech processing accuracy) proving difficult.
- **Scope Creep**: Adding features beyond the defined MVP.
- **Data Privacy Concerns**: Ensuring sensitive conversation data is handled correctly.
- **Solo Developer Burnout**: Maintaining consistent progress and motivation.

#### **6.2 Mitigation Strategies**

- **Budget Monitoring**: Implement real-time API usage alerts and fallback mechanisms.
- **Phased Development**: Tackle complex features incrementally with clear prototypes.
- **Strict Scope Control**: Adhere to the MVP definition, deferring non-essential features.
- **Privacy by Design**: Implement data anonymization, minimal retention, and secure storage.
- **Time Management**: Set realistic goals, take regular breaks, and celebrate small wins.

### **7. Quality Assurance Integration**

#### **7.1 Continuous Testing**

- **Unit Tests**: Integrate `pytest` for Python backend.
- **Integration Tests**: Verify interactions between FastAPI, databases, and AI services.
- **Frontend Tests**: Use Playwright for end-to-end tests for FastHTML, MonsterUI, and Alpine.js interactions.
- **Speech & AI Specific Tests**: Develop test cases for pronunciation feedback accuracy and conversational coherence.

#### **7.2 Code Review Process**

- **Self-Review**: Developers review their own code before creating a PR.
- **Peer Review (if applicable)**: For collaborative development, at least one reviewer approval is required.
- **Automated Checks**: Integrate linters (Black, ESLint), formatters (Isort, Prettier), and type checkers (Mypy, TypeScript) into CI.

### **8. Project Success Metrics & Validation**

#### **8.1 Technical Success Metrics**

### **9. Next Steps & Immediate Actions**

**Action Required**: Initialize TaskMaster-AI project structure (if applicable) and begin Document #9 (Test Plans & Quality Assurance Strategy) development, incorporating the revised technical stack and LLM orchestration approach.

**Success Metrics**: Document #9 outline completed within 48 hours, with clear, actionable testing strategies that align with the "full pythonic application" and MonsterUI/minimal Alpine.js frontend.

---

**Document Status**: Complete - Ready for TaskMaster-AI implementation and Document #9 creation
**Next Document**: #9 - Test Plans & Quality Assurance Strategy
**Validation**: Reviewed and approved by Qwen Max with critical recommendations integratedThe `doc8-task-management.md` document has been updated to reflect the agreed-upon technology stack and development philosophy.

Here's a summary of the key updates in the document:
* **Frontend Stack**: Explicitly states the use of **MonsterUI** as the primary UI component library, with **Alpine.js** to be used minimally for specific, localized interactivity, reinforcing the "full pythonic application" principle.
* **LLM Orchestration**: Clarifies that LLM orchestration, including multi-AI routing and RAG with ChromaDB, is handled directly by the **Python backend services (FastAPI)**, emphasizing that external JavaScript-based frameworks like LangChain are not used.
* **FastHTML**: Maintains FastHTML for server-rendered HTML, aligning with the Pythonic frontend approach.

The updated document is now ready for the next steps, including the initialization of the TaskMaster-AI project structure and the creation of Document #9 (Test Plans & Quality Assurance Strategy).
