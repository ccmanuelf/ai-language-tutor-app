    """Universal template for all scenario types"""
    
    # Core Identity
    scenario_id: str
    tier: int  # 1-4 for organization
    priority: int  # 1-20 for implementation order
    
    # Basic Information
    name: str
    category: ScenarioCategory
    difficulty: ScenarioDifficulty
    estimated_duration: int  # minutes
    
    # Learning Structure
    phases: List[ScenarioPhase]
    vocabulary_focus: List[str]
    grammar_patterns: List[str]
    cultural_contexts: Dict[str, Any]
    
    # Extensibility
    custom_fields: Dict[str, Any]  # For future expansion
    variations: List[ScenarioVariation]  # Cultural/regional variants
    prerequisites: List[str]
    follow_up_scenarios: List[str]
    
    # Metadata
    tags: List[str]
    last_updated: datetime
    version: str
```

#### **2. Dynamic Scenario Loading System**
```python
class ScenarioFactory:
    """Factory for creating scenarios dynamically"""
    
    def load_scenarios_by_tier(self, tier: int) -> List[ConversationScenario]:
        """Load scenarios by tier for progressive learning"""
        
    def load_scenarios_by_difficulty(self, difficulty: str) -> List[ConversationScenario]:
        """Load scenarios by difficulty level"""
        
    def create_custom_scenario(self, template: Dict[str, Any]) -> ConversationScenario:
        """Create custom scenarios from JSON/YAML templates"""
        
    def get_recommended_sequence(self, user_level: str) -> List[str]:
        """Get recommended scenario sequence for user level"""
```

#### **3. Content Management System**
```python
class ScenarioContentManager:
    """Manage scenario content and variations"""
    
    def add_cultural_variation(self, scenario_id: str, culture: str, variations: Dict):
        """Add cultural variations to existing scenarios"""
        
    def update_vocabulary(self, scenario_id: str, new_vocab: List[str]):
        """Update vocabulary for scenarios"""
        
    def add_difficulty_variant(self, scenario_id: str, difficulty: str):
        """Create difficulty variants of existing scenarios"""
```

#### **2. Plugin System for New Scenario Types**
```python
class ScenarioPlugin:
    """Base class for scenario plugins"""
    
    def register_scenario_type(self, type_name: str, handler: callable):
        """Register new scenario types"""
        
    def add_custom_phase_type(self, phase_type: str, logic: callable):
        """Add custom phase logic"""
        
    def integrate_external_content(self, source: str, mapper: callable):
        """Integrate content from external sources"""
```

#### **3. A/B Testing Framework**
```python
class ScenarioTester:
    """A/B testing for scenario effectiveness"""
    
    def create_variant(self, scenario_id: str, variant_name: str, changes: Dict):
        """Create scenario variants for testing"""
        
    def track_engagement(self, user_id: str, scenario_id: str, metrics: Dict):
        """Track user engagement and learning outcomes"""
        
    def analyze_effectiveness(self, scenario_id: str) -> Dict[str, float]:
        """Analyze scenario effectiveness"""
