## **2. System Overview**

### **2.1 System Context**
The AI Language Tutor App operates as a Python-first, Python-driven hybrid multi-service platform. It features a FastAPI backend and FastHTML frontend, integrating with cloud-based AI and speech services, and robust local LLM capabilities for offline operation. Data persistence utilizes a hybrid approach with MariaDB (server-side for metadata), ChromaDB (vector store), and DuckDB/SQLite (local/offline storage).

### **2.2 User Classes**
The application is designed for a maximum of three family users (Father, Daughter, Son). All users have identical capabilities and full autonomy within the application.

* **Primary User**: Developer (Parent) - Engages in personal language learning and utilizes the app for professional development and technical skill advancement.
* **Secondary Users**: Developer's Children - Utilize the app for language learning and educational support.

**Note on User Autonomy**: There is **no "System Administrator" role within the application's user management** for approving accounts or managing user details. All registered family members have equal access and control over their learning experience.

    * The system shall dynamically route requests to appropriate LLM providers (Anthropic Claude, Mistral, Alibaba Qwen) based on context, language, and cost.
    * The system shall utilize local LLMs (Ollama / LM Studio) for offline mode and budget protection, with a "mini router layer" and "prompt adapters."
    * The system shall ensure LLM outputs are validated (e.g., markdown, MermaidJS diagrams) to prevent injection risks.

* **FR-006 Speech Layer Integration**:
    * **Speech-to-Text (STT)**: The system shall use IBM Watson's speech-to-text API in WebSocket mode for real-time transcription. Browser-based Speech APIs shall serve as fallback.
    * **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: The system shall use IBM Watson's text-to-speech API to generate MP3 audio streams for AI responses. Browser-based Speech APIs shall serve as fallback.
    * The system shall provide real-time pronunciation, grammar, tone, timing, and accent feedback on user speech.

### **3.4 Learning Tracking & Offline Capability**

* **FR-007 Learning Tracking**:
    * The system shall implement the "Don't break the chain" strategy for streak-based learning.
    * The system shall track topics, languages engaged, and progress feedback for each user.
    * **The system shall not retain full conversation histories**.

* **FR-008 Offline Functionality**:
    * The system shall detect online/offline status and provide visual cues (e.g., banner "powered by Ollama â€¢ offline").
    * The system shall seamlessly transition to offline mode, utilizing local LLMs and local data storage (DuckDB/SQLite).
    * The system shall synchronize relevant learning progress data when connectivity is restored.

### **3.5 Budget Management**

* **FR-009 Budget Management**:
    * The system shall implement real-time API cost tracking.
    * The system shall automatically fallback to local LLMs (Ollama/LM Studio) when predefined budget thresholds are approached or exceeded, ensuring monthly costs remain under $30.
