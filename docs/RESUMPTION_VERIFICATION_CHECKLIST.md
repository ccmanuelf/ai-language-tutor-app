# Session Resumption Verification Checklist
## Ensuring Complete Context for New Chat Sessions

**Purpose**: Verify that all necessary files and information are in place for seamless session resumption  
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-14 (Post-Session 3)  
**Use**: Run this checklist before starting ANY new chat session

---

## ‚úÖ Pre-Session Verification (5 minutes)

### Critical Files Existence Check

Run this command to verify all files exist:
```bash
ls -lh docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md \
       docs/DAILY_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md \
       docs/SESSION_4_RESUMPTION_GUIDE.md \
       validation_artifacts/4.2.6/SESSION_3_HANDOVER.md \
       validation_artifacts/4.2.6/PHASE_2C_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md \
       validation_artifacts/4.2.6/TIER_3A_COMPLETION_REPORT.md \
       validation_artifacts/4.2.6/PHASE_2C_REVISED_EXECUTION_PLAN.md \
       validation_artifacts/4.2.6/PHASE_2C_REALITY_CHECK_REPORT.md
```

**Expected**: All 8 files should exist with reasonable sizes (>10KB)

### File Content Verification

- [ ] **PROJECT_STATUS.md** shows current phase (Phase 2C)
- [ ] **PROJECT_STATUS.md** shows current tier (TIER 3A COMPLETE, Next: TIER 3B)
- [ ] **PROJECT_STATUS.md** shows current completion (60%, 27/45 functions)
- [ ] **SESSION_3_HANDOVER.md** exists and is dated 2025-10-14
- [ ] **PHASE_2C_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md** shows TIER 3A as 100% complete
- [ ] **DAILY_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md** mentions TIER 3B as next milestone

### Codebase State Verification

```bash
# C-level function count should be 18
radon cc app/ -s -n C | wc -l

# D/E-level should be 0
radon cc app/ -s -n D | wc -l
radon cc app/ -s -n E | wc -l

# Integration tests should pass
python -m pytest tests/integration/ -v | grep "passed"
```

**Expected Results**:
- C-level count: 18
- D-level count: 0
- E-level count: 0
- Integration tests: 8 passed

### Git Repository State

```bash
# Should be clean
git status

# Should be on main branch
git branch --show-current

# Should be synchronized with remote
git fetch origin
git status | grep "up to date"

# Last commit should be documentation
git log --oneline -1
```

**Expected Results**:
- Working tree: clean
- Branch: main
- Remote sync: up to date with origin/main
- Last commit: Documentation package or similar

## üîç Content Cross-Verification

### Consistency Checks

Run these checks to ensure all documents are synchronized:

```bash
# Extract completion percentage from different files
grep -h "60%" docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md validation_artifacts/4.2.6/SESSION_3_HANDOVER.md

# Verify TIER 3A is marked complete in all files
grep -h "TIER 3A.*COMPLETE" docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md validation_artifacts/4.2.6/PHASE_2C_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md

# Verify C-level count is documented as 18
grep -h "18.*C-level\|C-level.*18" docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md validation_artifacts/4.2.6/SESSION_3_HANDOVER.md

# Verify TIER 3B has 6 functions documented
grep -h "TIER 3B.*6\|6.*functions.*TIER 3B" docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md docs/SESSION_4_RESUMPTION_GUIDE.md
```

**Expected**: All searches should return matching results from multiple files

### Numerical Consistency

These numbers should be consistent across all files:

- **Total Functions**: 45 (adjusted from original 40)
- **Completed Functions**: 27 (Sessions 1-3)
- **Completion Percentage**: 60% (27/45)
- **Remaining Functions**: 18
  - TIER 3B: 6 functions (C:12)
  - TIER 3C: 12 functions (C:11)
- **C-level Count (radon)**: 18
- **D-level Count (radon)**: 0
- **E-level Count (radon)**: 0
- **Integration Tests**: 8/8 passing
- **Average Reduction**: 81.2%
- **Total Helpers Created**: 129

### Verify in Each File:

- [ ] PROJECT_STATUS.md shows 27/45 (60%)
- [ ] SESSION_3_HANDOVER.md shows 27/45 (60%)
- [ ] PHASE_2C_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md shows 27/45 (60%)
- [ ] All files agree on TIER 3B having 6 functions
- [ ] All files agree on TIER 3C having 12 functions
- [ ] All files show C-level count as 18

- [ ] Validation commands to run
- [ ] Expected outputs for validation
- [ ] Next task clearly stated (TIER 3B, MistralService.generate_response)
