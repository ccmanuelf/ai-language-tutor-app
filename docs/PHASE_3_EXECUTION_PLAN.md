    interval_modifier: float = 1.0
) -> float:
    """Calculate memory retention score based on spaced repetition.
    
    Uses the SM-2 algorithm with custom interval modifiers to predict
    the likelihood of successful recall.
    
    Args:
        review_history: List of previous review attempts with timestamps
            and results. Each dict must have 'timestamp' and 'success' keys.
        difficulty: Item difficulty factor (0.0-1.0), where higher values
            indicate more difficult items requiring more frequent review.
        interval_modifier: Optional multiplier for review intervals.
            Defaults to 1.0. Use <1.0 for faster reviews, >1.0 for slower.
    
    Returns:
        Retention score between 0.0 and 1.0, where 1.0 indicates high
        confidence of successful recall.
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: If review_history is empty or difficulty is out of range.
    
    Examples:
        >>> history = [{'timestamp': '2024-01-01', 'success': True}]

1. **Feature inventory** (working, broken, missing features)
2. **System health report** (comprehensive state assessment)
3. **Gap analysis** (actual vs expected functionality)
4. **Phase 4 roadmap** (prioritized feature backlog)
5. **User acceptance testing results**

### Tasks Breakdown

  - 🔲 Missing (planned but not implemented)
- Document findings with evidence
- Create feature status matrix

**Feature Categories to Test**:
- User authentication and authorization
- Language configuration
- Conversation management
- AI provider routing
- Speech processing (STT/TTS)
- Content processing
- Learning analytics
- Spaced repetition
- Progress tracking
- Scenario-based learning
- Feature toggles
- Admin dashboard

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Complete feature list documented
- ✅ Each feature tested end-to-end
- ✅ Status categorization complete
- ✅ Evidence of testing provided (screenshots, logs)

#### 3F.2: System Health Assessment (2-3 days)

**Objective**: Comprehensive system health evaluation

**Tasks**:

- Estimate effort for each gap

**Gap Categories**:
- **Critical Gaps**: Core functionality missing
- **Important Gaps**: Valuable features missing
- **Enhancement Gaps**: Nice-to-have features
- **Technical Debt**: Implementation shortcuts

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Gap analysis complete
- ✅ Missing features identified
- ✅ Priorities assigned
- ✅ Effort estimated

#### 3F.4: User Acceptance Testing (3-4 days)

**Objective**: Validate system meets user needs (family use case)

**Tasks**:
- Define user personas (parent, child learner)
- Create user test scenarios (realistic workflows)
- Test conversation flows with different AI providers
- Test learning progress tracking over time
- Test content upload and processing
- Test scenario-based learning experiences
- Document user experience issues
- Collect feedback and suggestions

**User Test Scenarios**:
1. **New User Onboarding**: Register → Set language → First conversation
2. **Learning Session**: Start conversation → AI interaction → Save progress
3. **Content Learning**: Upload PDF → Process → Learn from content
4. **Progress Review**: View analytics → Check retention → Review due items
5. **Scenario Learning**: Select scenario → Complete conversation → Review

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ All user scenarios tested
- ✅ User experience issues documented
- ✅ Feedback collected
- ✅ Usability assessment complete

#### 3F.5: Phase 4 Planning (2-3 days)

**Objective**: Create roadmap for future development

**Tasks**:
- Compile prioritized feature backlog
- Define Phase 4 objectives (new features vs fixes)
- Estimate effort for each feature
- Create high-level roadmap (phases, milestones)
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Document recommended next steps

**Phase 4 Planning Contents**:
1. **Current State Summary** (Phase 3F findings)
2. **Feature Backlog** (prioritized list)
3. **Phase 4 Objectives** (what to build next)
4. **Effort Estimates** (rough sizing)
5. **Roadmap** (timeline, milestones)
6. **Dependencies** (technical, external)
7. **Risks** (what could go wrong)
8. **Recommendations** (proposed approach)

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Feature backlog prioritized
- ✅ Phase 4 objectives defined
- ✅ Roadmap created
- ✅ Effort estimates documented

### Phase 3F Success Metrics

**Assessment Metrics**:
- ✅ Complete feature inventory
- ✅ All critical features working
- ✅ Gap analysis complete
- ✅ User acceptance testing done

**Planning Metrics**:
- ✅ Phase 4 roadmap ready
- ✅ Feature backlog prioritized
- ✅ Effort estimates provided
- ✅ Clear next steps defined

## Project Philosophy Reminder

> "Quality and reliability is our goal by whatever it takes. Time is not a constraint."

Phase 3 embodies this philosophy through:
- **Comprehensive testing** (>90% coverage target)
- **Thorough validation** (performance, documentation, quality)
- **Automated enforcement** (CI/CD preventing regression)
- **Methodical approach** (sequential phases with clear objectives)
- **Evidence-based progress** (all claims backed by measurements)
