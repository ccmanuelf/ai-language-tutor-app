I'm always excited to hear when people are getting into it. \n\n*tilts head slightly* So what got you interested in Python in the first place? Is this something new for you, or have you worked with other languages before? I'm always curious to hear people's programming journeys - there are just so many different paths you can take.\n\n*nods enthusiastically* And web development, huh? That's a really fun and dynamic field. There's just endless possibilities with what you can create on the web these days. Do you have any particular projects or ideas you're working on? I'd love to hear more about what's got you excited about Python for web dev.\n\n*leans back and smiles warmly* Anyway, I'm happy",
