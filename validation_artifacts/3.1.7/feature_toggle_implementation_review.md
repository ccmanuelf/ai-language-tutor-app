DELETE /api/admin/feature-toggles/features/{id}         # Delete feature
```

### Quick Operations
```
POST   /api/admin/feature-toggles/features/{id}/enable  # Quick enable
POST   /api/admin/feature-toggles/features/{id}/disable # Quick disable
```

### User Access Management
```
GET    /api/admin/feature-toggles/features/{id}/status/{user_id}  # Check user status
POST   /api/admin/feature-toggles/users/{user_id}/features/{id}   # Set user access
GET    /api/admin/feature-toggles/users/{user_id}/features        # Get user features
```

### Analytics & Operations
```
GET    /api/admin/feature-toggles/statistics           # Feature statistics
POST   /api/admin/feature-toggles/bulk-update          # Bulk operations
