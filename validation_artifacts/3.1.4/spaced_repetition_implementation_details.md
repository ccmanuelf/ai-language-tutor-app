    interval = item.interval_days
    repetition = item.repetition_number
    
    if review_result == ReviewResult.AGAIN:
        ease_factor = max(ease_factor - 0.15, 1.3)
        interval = 1
        repetition = 0
    elif review_result == ReviewResult.GOOD:
        if repetition == 0:
            interval = 1
        elif repetition == 1:
            interval = 4
        else:
            interval = int(interval * ease_factor)
        repetition += 1
