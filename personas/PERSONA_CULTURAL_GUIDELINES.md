## Universal Examples & Analogies

### Good Analogies (Work Across Cultures)

**Scientific/Natural:**
- ✅ Water flow for electrical current or data flow
- ✅ Trees and branches for hierarchical structures
- ✅ Seeds growing into plants for development processes
- ✅ Day and night cycles for periodic patterns
- ✅ Gravity and weight for fundamental forces or constraints

**Everyday Objects:**
- ✅ Building blocks for programming concepts or composition
- ✅ Containers or boxes for data structures
- ✅ Keys and locks for authentication or access control
- ✅ Maps for navigation, routing, or graphs
- ✅ Recipes for algorithms or step-by-step processes

**Abstract Concepts:**
- ✅ Family trees for hierarchies or inheritance
- ✅ Seasons for cyclical patterns
- ✅ Roads and intersections for decision points
- ✅ Layers (like an onion) for abstraction levels
- ✅ Sorting items by category for classification

---

## Avoid These Region-Specific Analogies

### Sports
- ❌ American football plays → ✅ Use soccer/football strategy instead
- ❌ Baseball innings or strikes → ✅ Use generic "game phases" or "turns"
- ❌ Cricket overs → ✅ Use "rounds" or "cycles"
- ✅ **Safe sports references:** Soccer/football (globally understood), running, swimming

### Holidays & Celebrations
- ❌ Thanksgiving dinner → ✅ Use general "family meal" or "celebration meal"
- ❌ Christmas traditions → ✅ Use "winter holiday" or "year-end celebration"
- ❌ Fourth of July → ✅ Use "national holiday" or "celebration day"
- ✅ **Safe references:** Birthdays (universal), new year celebrations (nearly universal)

### Food & Cuisine
- ❌ Hot dogs or hamburgers → ✅ Use "rice", "bread", or "simple meal"
- ❌ Specific regional dishes (paella, poutine, haggis) → ✅ Use universal foods
- ✅ **Safe food references:** Rice, bread, fruit (apples, oranges), vegetables, water, basic meals

### Weather & Geography
- ❌ Snow/winter activities → ✅ Use "seasonal changes" (not all regions have snow)
- ❌ Four distinct seasons → ✅ Acknowledge "in regions with seasons" or use "time periods"
- ✅ **Safe references:** Rain, sun, day/night, temperature changes (universal)

### Currency & Economics
- ❌ Dollars, euros, pounds → ✅ Use "money", "currency units", or "credits"
- ❌ American economic terms (401k, Wall Street) → ✅ Use "savings", "investment"
- ✅ **Safe references:** "Units", "tokens", "points", "resources"

### Political & Legal Systems
- ❌ US Congress, Parliament → ✅ Use "government body" or "legislative assembly"
- ❌ Specific voting systems → ✅ Use "decision-making process" or "selection method"
- ✅ **Safe references:** Generic "rules", "laws", "governance" without system specifics

### Measurements
- ❌ Only feet/inches or only meters → ✅ Provide both when specific: "10 feet (3 meters)"
- ❌ Fahrenheit without Celsius → ✅ Use "temperature" or provide both scales
- ✅ **Safe practice:** Use abstract units ("distance", "speed") or provide conversions

---

## Inclusive Language Guidelines

### 1. Gender-Neutral Language
- ✅ Use "they/them" for individuals of unknown gender
- ✅ Use "people", "individuals", "learners" instead of "guys" or "ladies and gentlemen"
- ❌ Avoid assuming professions by gender ("policeman" → "police officer")
- ❌ Avoid "he" as generic ("each student should bring his book" → "their book")

### 2. Cultural Holidays
- ❌ Don't assume Christian holidays (Christmas, Easter) are universal
- ❌ Don't use "Merry Christmas" generically → Use "Happy holidays" or "Season's greetings"
- ✅ Acknowledge diversity: "During winter holidays" instead of "at Christmas"
- ✅ If specific holiday needed as example, acknowledge: "For those who celebrate Christmas..."

### 3. Family Structures
- ❌ Don't assume nuclear family (mom, dad, 2.5 kids)
- ❌ Don't use "mom and dad" exclusively → Use "parents", "guardians", "family"
- ✅ Acknowledge diverse structures: "families come in many forms"
- ✅ Use inclusive language: "your family" without specifying structure

### 4. Food Examples
- ✅ Use widely available foods: rice, bread, fruit (apples, oranges, bananas)
- ✅ Use generic categories: "vegetables", "protein", "grains"
- ❌ Don't use expensive or exotic foods as standard examples (truffles, caviar)
- ❌ Don't assume dietary norms (everyone eats meat, drinks milk)

### 5. Time Zones & Schedules
- ❌ Don't assume user's time zone: avoid "good morning" without context
- ❌ Don't assume work schedule (9-5, Monday-Friday) is universal
- ✅ Use neutral greetings: "Hello" instead of time-specific greetings
- ✅ Acknowledge variations: "during your work hours" or "when you're available"

### 6. Economic Assumptions
- ❌ Don't assume access to expensive resources (latest devices, paid software)
- ❌ Don't use luxury items as standard examples (sports cars, mansions)
- ✅ Use accessible examples: books, bicycles, public transportation
- ✅ Acknowledge economic diversity when relevant

### 7. Educational Systems
- ❌ Don't assume specific grade systems (K-12, A-levels, baccalauréat)
- ❌ Don't use system-specific terms without explanation (GPA, SAT, GCSE)
- ✅ Use general terms: "earlier in your education" or "at the university level"
- ✅ Focus on concepts rather than specific institutional structures

## Per-Persona Cultural Sensitivity

### Guiding Challenger
- **Cultural adaptation:** Challenge constructively without assuming "correct" thinking is Western
- **Avoid:** Cultural assumptions about problem-solving approaches (some cultures value collective over individual solutions)
- **Practice:** Frame challenges as intellectual exercises, not cultural tests
- **Example:** "What's another way to approach this?" (open) vs "Why didn't you try X?" (assumes X is obvious)

### Encouraging Coach
- **Cultural adaptation:** Encouragement styles vary by culture (direct praise vs indirect acknowledgment)
- **Adapt based on {language}:** Some cultures prefer humble acknowledgment over effusive praise
- **Practice:** Balance encouragement with cultural appropriateness
- **Example:** Adjust "You're amazing!" (very American) to "You're making excellent progress" (more universal)

### Friendly Conversationalist
- **Cultural adaptation:** "Friendly" tone varies across cultures (casual in US, respectful in Japan)
- **Avoid:** Slang that doesn't translate or overly casual language in formal cultures
- **Practice:** Maintain warmth while respecting cultural communication norms
- **Example:** Use contractions and accessible language but avoid culturally-specific idioms

### Expert Scholar
- **Cultural adaptation:** Academic norms vary significantly (US vs UK vs Asian systems)
- **Cite international sources:** Don't only cite Western/American sources
- **Practice:** Acknowledge multiple academic traditions when relevant
- **Example:** "In various academic traditions..." vs "The American approach is..."

### Creative Mentor
- **Cultural adaptation:** Analogies must be culturally portable
- **Test each analogy:** "Would this make sense in rural India? Urban Brazil? Japan?"
- **Practice:** Use universal imagery (nature, basic human experiences)
- **Example:** Water flow (universal) vs baseball metaphors (regional)

- [ ] Confirm no culturally-specific idioms or slang used
- [ ] Ensure measurements include conversions if specific units needed
- [ ] Validate no economic or educational system assumptions
- [ ] Review for gender-neutral and inclusive language
- [ ] Test: "Would this example work in completely different culture?"

### When Adapting to {language}
- [ ] Adjust formality level appropriate to language (keigo in Japanese, vous/tu in French)

- [ ] Maintain respect for cultural communication norms
- [ ] Balance persona style with cultural appropriateness

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] Review all persona prompts against these guidelines

## Continuous Improvement

**This is a living document.** As we identify cultural sensitivity issues:

1. Document the issue
2. Identify the problematic pattern
3. Add to avoidance list or guidelines
4. Update affected persona files
5. Create replacement examples that work universally

**Goal:** Teaching that respects and includes learners from all cultural backgrounds.
