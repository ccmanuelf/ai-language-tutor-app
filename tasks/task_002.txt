# Description: Develop user profile management system supporting developer and child accounts, language preferences, progress tracking, and child protections.
# Details:
Design user schema with fields for user type (developer/child), language preferences, progress data, and child protection flags. Use localStorage or IndexedDB for client-side persistence. Implement UI for profile creation, editing, and switching. Add child account protections (e.g., restricted settings, parental controls).
