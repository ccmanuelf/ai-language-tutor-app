# FastHTML Framework Configuration
# FastHTML uses star imports (from fasthtml.common import *) as its standard pattern
# This is intentional and documented: https://docs.fasthtml.dev/

# F403: 'from module import *' used; unable to detect undefined names
# F405: name may be undefined, or defined from star imports
# Reason: FastHTML's design pattern - provides clean, intuitive API
