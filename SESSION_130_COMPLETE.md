## 💡 LESSONS LEARNED

### What Worked Well
1. **Python Script Approach** - Programmatic addition was faster and more reliable than manual JSON editing
2. **Incremental Addition** - Adding scenarios in batches with checkpoints prevented data loss
3. **Comprehensive Planning** - SESSION_130_SCENARIOS_DRAFT.md made implementation straightforward
4. **Backup Strategy** - scenarios.json.backup provided safety net
5. **Quality-First Mindset** - Not rushing led to better scenario design

### What Could Be Improved
1. **Could have validated JSON after each scenario addition** - Would catch errors earlier
2. **Could have created automated tests for scenario structure** - Would provide ongoing validation

### Recommendations for Future Sessions
1. **Continue using Python scripts for bulk data operations** - Proven reliable
2. **Always create backups before modifying production data** - Essential safety
3. **Design first, implement second** - Planning phase saves implementation time
4. **Test incrementally** - Don't wait until end to validate
