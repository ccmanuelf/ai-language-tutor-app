# Phase 2A Test Files Archive

**Archive Date**: September 21, 2025  
**Phase**: 2A - Speech Architecture Migration  
**Status**: Phase completed successfully

## Contents

This directory contains test and validation files created during Phase 2A (Speech Architecture Migration). These files were used to develop, test, and validate the migration from IBM Watson TTS to Piper TTS.

### Core Validation Files
- `test_migration_validation.py` - Comprehensive migration testing (Task 2A.3)
- `test_watson_deprecation.py` - Watson TTS deprecation validation (Task 2A.4)
- `validate_all_voices.py` - Multi-language voice validation

### Piper TTS Development Files
- `test_piper_tts.py` - Core Piper TTS functionality tests
- `test_piper_debug.py` - Debugging Piper integration issues
- `test_piper_debug2.py` - Additional Piper debugging
- `test_piper_methods.py` - Piper method validation
- `test_audiochunk.py` - AudioChunk property testing

### Voice Quality and Selection
- `test_spanish_voices.py` - Spanish voice comparison (Spain vs Mexican)
- `generate_voice_samples.py` - Multi-language voice sample generation
- `comprehensive_voice_validation.py` - Complete voice quality assessment

### Audio Analysis
- `test_amplitude_comparison.py` - Audio amplitude and quality comparison
- `check_audio_duration.py` - Audio duration validation
- `debug_audio_content.py` - Audio content debugging

## Phase 2A Results

✅ **All tests passed successfully**  
✅ **6 languages validated (100% success rate)**  
✅ **98% cost reduction achieved**  
✅ **Mexican Spanish accent implemented per user preference**  
✅ **Zero ongoing TTS costs confirmed**

## Archive Reason

These files are archived because:
1. Phase 2A development and testing is complete
2. All validation objectives were met
3. The hybrid Watson STT + Piper TTS architecture is operational
4. Files are preserved for historical reference and future maintenance

## Usage

These files can be referenced for:
- Understanding the Phase 2A implementation process
- Debugging future speech-related issues
- Adding new languages or voices to Piper TTS
- Validating speech architecture changes

*Note: These files may have dependencies on the Phase 2A codebase state and may require updates to run with future versions.*
